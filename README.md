Energy dissipated through the shock absorber as heat can be transformed into electricity and stored in a battery for other use in the vehicle. This work provides a solution to regenerate energy through a Cycloid transmission coupled with an Electric Motor.

Project description 


Energy losses in automobile cars nowadays are significant. To improve fuel economy in cars, reduce Co2 emissions and supply other power demand systems, recovery systems were developed such as the regenerative braking energy and others are gaining attention like vibration energy recovery on shock absorbers. Therefore, this energy dissipated through the shock absorber as heat can be transformed into electricity and stored in a battery for other use in the vehicle.
