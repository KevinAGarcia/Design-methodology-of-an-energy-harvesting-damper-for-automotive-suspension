# Design-methodology-of-an-energy-harvesting-damper-for-automotive-suspension



Project description 


Energy losses in automobile cars nowadays are significant. To improve fuel economy in cars, reduce Co2 emissions and supply other power demand systems, recovery systems were developed such as the regenerative braking energy and others are gaining attention like vibration energy recovery on shock absorbers. Therefore, this energy dissipated through the shock absorber as heat can be transformed into electricity and stored in a battery for other use in the vehicle. 



The main contribution of this research project is :
1. The implementation of a Cycloid Drive which was never used for this type of application and is totally new in the state of the art.
2. The optimization design methodology to couple both components together, the Electric Motor model and the Cycloid Drive model. A way to link them is presented, and several tests are performed with the parameters of the EV-TEC.


Ev tec

An electric vehicle developed by students and professors from Tec de Monterrey.
For this project, the parameters of this vehicle are used, and the regenerative elements are going to be tested in the rear end of the suspension.
